# File Header Documentation

This document outlines the standardized comment header structure to be used at the top of every file in the project.

## Header Structure

The header follows JSDoc syntax and includes comprehensive metadata about the file, its purpose, authorship, and requirements.

### Basic Format

````js
/**
 * @fileoverview [Brief description of the file's purpose]
 * @project     [Project name] ([Project version])
 * @module      [Module/Component name]
 *
 * @author      [Primary author name] <[email]>
 * @contributors [Contributor1 name] <[email]>, [Contributor2 name] <[email]>
 * @maintainer  [Current maintainer name] <[email]>
 *
 * @created     [YYYY-MM-DD]
 * @modified    [YYYY-MM-DD]
 * @version     [File version]
 *
 * @license     [License type] - see LICENSE.md file in root directory
 * @copyright   Copyright (c) [YYYY] [Organization/Owner name]
 *
 * @description
 * [Detailed description of the file's functionality, purpose, and any important notes]
 * [Include any major dependencies or requirements]
 * [Note any specific configurations or environment requirements]
 *
 * @example
 * ```js
 * // Basic usage example of the main functionality
 * import { MainComponent } from './MainComponent';
 * const instance = new MainComponent();
 * ```
 *
 * @dependencies
 * - [Dependency1 name]@[version]
 * - [Dependency2 name]@[version]
 *
 * @requirements
 * - [Requirement1]
 * - [Requirement2]
 */

## Example Implementation

Here's a complete example showing how to use the header in a real file:

````js
/**
 * @fileoverview User authentication and authorization service implementation
 * @project     E-Commerce Platform (v2.5.0)

 *
 * @author      Jane Smith <jane.smith@company.com>

 * @maintainer  Jane Smith <jane.smith@company.com>
 *
 * @created     2025-01-08
 * @modified    2025-01-08
 * @version     1.0.0
 *
 * @license     MIT - see LICENSE.md file in root directory
 * @copyright   Copyright (c) 2025 E-Commerce Platform Inc.
 *
 * @description
 * Provides comprehensive authentication and authorization services including user
 * registration, login, password reset, and session management. Implements JWT-based
 * authentication with refresh token rotation and role-based access control (RBAC).
 * Includes rate limiting and security measures against common attack vectors.
 *
 * @example
 * ```js
 * import { AuthService } from './services/AuthService';
 * const authService = new AuthService();
 * const user = await authService.login(email, password);

 *
 * @dependencies
 * - jsonwebtoken@9.0.2
 * - bcrypt@5.1.1
 * - express-rate-limit@7.1.5

## Usage Guidelines

1. Place this header at the very top of each file, before any imports or code
2. Keep the format consistent across all files
3. Update the `@modified` date whenever significant changes are made
4. Ensure all required fields are filled out
5. Include relevant optional fields based on the file's complexity
6. Keep descriptions clear and concise
7. Use proper formatting for code examples
8. List all direct dependencies with exact versions
9. Document any specific requirements needed to use the file

## Maintenance

- Update the header whenever significant changes are made to the file
- Keep the contributor list up to date
- Ensure version numbers are incremented appropriately
- Maintain accurate dependency versions
- Update requirements as they change
