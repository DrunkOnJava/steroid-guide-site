    question: "What are the common side effects of steroids?",
    answer:
      "Common side effects include acne, hair loss, mood changes, increased blood pressure, liver stress (with oral steroids), gynecomastia, and suppression of natural testosterone production. Side effects vary by compound and can be minimized with proper cycle management and support supplements.",

    question: "How do I manage water retention during a steroid cycle?",
    answer:
      "Control water retention through proper diet (moderate sodium intake), maintaining healthy estrogen levels with an AI if needed, staying hydrated, and doing regular cardiovascular exercise. Some compounds are also less prone to causing water retention than others.",

  {
    question: "What blood tests should I take during a steroid cycle?",
    answer:
      "Essential blood tests include complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, lipid panel, testosterone, estradiol, and PSA (if over 30). Monitor these pre-cycle, mid-cycle (weeks 6-8), and post-PCT to ensure health markers remain in range.",

  {
    question: "Can I drink alcohol during a steroid cycle?",
    answer:
      "Alcohol consumption during a cycle is not recommended. It can increase liver stress (especially with oral steroids), interfere with protein synthesis, affect hormone levels, and impair recovery. If you must drink, do so very moderately and avoid it completely with oral steroids.",
    category: "health",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I monitor my health during a cycle?",
    answer:
      "Regular blood work is essential, including hormone panels, liver function, lipids, and complete blood count. Monitor blood pressure daily, watch for side effects, maintain regular check-ups, and keep detailed logs of doses and any symptoms. Stop immediately if serious health issues arise.",

  {
    question: "How do steroids affect cardiovascular health?",
    answer:
      "Steroids can impact cardiovascular health by affecting cholesterol levels (lowering HDL, raising LDL), increasing blood pressure, and potentially causing left ventricular hypertrophy. Regular cardio, clean diet, and supplements like fish oil can help mitigate these risks.",

  {
    question: "Can I use steroids if I am under 25 years old?",
    answer:
      "Using anabolic steroids under 25 is not recommended. The endocrine system is still developing, and early use can permanently disrupt natural hormone production. Additionally, the body is still capable of significant natural gains at this age through proper training and nutrition.",

  {
    question: "How do steroids affect mental health?",
    answer:
      "Steroids can significantly impact mental health, causing mood swings, aggression ('roid rage'), anxiety, or depression. These effects can be more pronounced during PCT. Having support systems in place and monitoring mental health is crucial. Seek professional help if needed.",
    category: "health",
  },
  {
    question: "How do steroids impact natural testosterone production?",
    answer:
      "Anabolic steroids suppress natural testosterone production through negative feedback loops. The degree and duration of suppression varies by compound and cycle length. This is why proper PCT is crucial - it helps restart natural production. Some users may require TRT if natural production doesn't recover.",
