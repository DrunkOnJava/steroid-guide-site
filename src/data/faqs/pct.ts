    question: "What is post-cycle therapy (PCT), and why is it necessary?",
    answer:
      "Post Cycle Therapy (PCT) is a protocol used after a steroid cycle to restore natural hormone production. It typically involves medications like Nolvadex or Clomid. PCT is crucial for maintaining gains, preventing post-cycle depression, and restoring hormonal balance. Without proper PCT, you risk losing muscle mass and experiencing prolonged hormonal disruption.",

    question: "What are the best post-cycle therapy protocols?",
    answer:
      "Standard PCT protocols typically involve SERMs like Nolvadex (20-40mg/day) or Clomid (50-100mg/day) for 4-6 weeks. HCG may be used before starting SERMs. The exact protocol depends on cycle length, compounds used, and individual response. Blood work should guide PCT adjustments.",
