    question: "How important is training intensity during a steroid cycle?",
    answer:
      "Training intensity should be high to maximize the anabolic effects of steroids. However, avoid overtraining as steroids can mask fatigue. Focus on progressive overload, adequate rest between sets, and proper form. Recovery time between workouts may be reduced due to enhanced recovery.",
