    question: "What role does diet play during a steroid cycle?",
    answer:
      "Diet is crucial during a cycle. You need adequate protein (1.5-2g per pound of bodyweight), sufficient calories for growth, and proper micronutrients. Clean eating helps minimize fat gain and manage side effects. Meal timing and post-workout nutrition become even more important when using AAS.",
