    question: "How do I properly store anabolic steroids?",
    answer:
      "Store in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Most compounds should be kept at room temperature (20-25Â°C). Injectable oils should never be frozen. Keep in original containers, clearly labeled, and secure from unauthorized access. Some compounds may require refrigeration.",
