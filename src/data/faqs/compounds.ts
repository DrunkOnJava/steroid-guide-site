    question: "How does testosterone cypionate differ from enanthate?",
    answer:
      "Testosterone cypionate and enanthate are very similar in terms of effects and half-life. The main difference is the ester attached. Cypionate has a slightly longer half-life (8 days vs 7 days for enanthate). Choice between the two often comes down to availability and personal preference.",

    question: "What is the purpose of stacking steroids?",
    answer:
      "Stacking involves combining different steroids to achieve specific goals. Each compound may have unique properties that complement each other. For example, combining a mass-building compound with one known for hardening effects. However, stacking increases complexity and potential side effects.",

    question: "What is the role of HCG in a steroid cycle?",
    answer:
      "Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) helps maintain testicular function during a cycle by mimicking LH. This can prevent testicular atrophy, maintain fertility, and make PCT easier. Typical protocols include using HCG throughout the cycle or as a bridge to PCT.",

    question: "What is the role of insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1)?",
    answer:
      "IGF-1 plays a crucial role in muscle growth and recovery. Anabolic steroids can increase IGF-1 production, enhancing their muscle-building effects. IGF-1 levels should be monitored through blood work as excessive levels may pose health risks.",

  {
    question: "How do I choose between bulking and cutting steroids?",
    answer:
      "Bulking compounds (like testosterone, deca) promote mass gain and typically cause more water retention. Cutting compounds (like trenbolone, winstrol) help preserve muscle while dieting and often provide a harder appearance. Choose based on your goals and experience level.",

  {
    question: "What is the role of estrogen blockers in a cycle?",
    answer:
      "Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) and SERMs control estrogen-related side effects like gynecomastia and water retention. However, some estrogen is beneficial for gains and health. The key is finding the right balance - only use what's necessary to control sides, as crashed estrogen causes its own problems.",
