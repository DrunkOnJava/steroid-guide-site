### Hormone-Related Terms

- **LH**: Luteinizing Hormone - stimulates testosterone production
- **FSH**: Follicle Stimulating Hormone - important for sperm production
- **E2**: Estradiol - primary form of estrogen
- **DHT**: Dihydrotestosterone - androgenic hormone derived from testosterone
- **GnRH**: Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone - triggers LH and FSH release

## Training and Physiology Terms
